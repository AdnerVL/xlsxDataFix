## The PhoneFix.ps1 script is designed to format phone numbers in an Excel file. Here's a brief description of its functionality:

- Input: It takes a file path as a mandatory parameter ($FilePath).
File Check: It first checks if the specified file exists, exiting if it doesn't.
- Module Installation: It checks for the presence of the ImportExcel PowerShell module. If not found, it attempts to install it, importing it otherwise.
- Backup: Before making changes, it creates a backup of the original Excel file with a timestamp in the filename.
- Phone Number Formatting: It defines a function Format-PhoneNumber that formats a 10-digit phone number into the format (XXX) XXX-XXXX, leaving other numbers unchanged.
- Sheet Processing: 
Opens the Excel file to get all sheet names.
For each sheet, it reads the data, searches for columns named 'PhoneNumber' or 'phonenumber', formats the numbers if they match the 10-digit criteria, and writes changes back to the file.
- Output: 
It informs the user whether changes were made or not, and where the backup is stored.
If changes were made, it displays a sample row from the first sheet after updating to confirm the changes.

This script ensures data integrity by backing up the original file before modification and provides feedback on the operations performed.
